AI-assisted visual migration from any Shopify theme to any target theme. Think of it as `git pull` for theme visuals — you point it at a live site and a target theme, and it systematically matches every section.

## Quick Start

```
/theme-forge onboard    — Configure a project for migration
/theme-forge scan       — Inventory all pages, sections, and settings
/theme-forge map-section <name>  — Assess compatibility of a single section
/theme-forge map-page [path]    — Map all sections on a page
/theme-forge reconcile [--page <template>]  — Detect work already done, create report stubs
/theme-forge pull-section <name> [--page <template>] — Execute compare→fix→verify on a section
/theme-forge pull-page [path]   — Pull all sections on a page
/theme-forge pull-header        — Pull the site header
/theme-forge pull-footer        — Pull the site footer
/theme-forge review [path]      — Post-work variance review
/theme-forge status             — Human-readable migration progress report
/theme-forge status --page <t>  — List all sections on a page with pull commands
/theme-forge status --next      — Show the next section to pull
/theme-forge capture <url> --section <sel> — Section-scoped screenshot at all breakpoints
/theme-forge cutover            — Show cutover checklist for production go-live
/theme-forge upgrade            — Check for and apply updates
/theme-forge --debug on         — Enable debug mode globally (persists in config.json)
/theme-forge --debug off        — Disable debug mode globally
```

## How It Works

theme-forge is a multi-skill repo. Each command above maps to a subdirectory with its own SKILL.md. This orchestrator routes commands to the right sub-skill.

### Command Routing

When invoked as `/theme-forge <command> [args]`:

1. Parse the command name from the first argument
2. Load the sub-skill SKILL.md from the corresponding directory
3. Pass remaining arguments to the sub-skill
4. If no command is given, show the quick start reference above
5. **Natural language shortcuts** — route these to `status`:
   - "what's next?" / "next section" / "what should I pull?" → `status --next`
   - "list sections on [page]" / "show me the [page] sections" / "what's on the homepage?" → `status --page <template>`
   - "what's left?" / "what sections are remaining?" → `status --detail`

### Pipeline Flags

These flags modify pipeline behavior for batch operations (`pull-page`, `pull-header`, `pull-footer`, or `--full`):

```
--full                 Run pull on ALL sections across all mapped pages
--globals-only         Run scan→map→globals→header→footer, commit, then stop
--retry-failed         Retry sections with failed reports
--debug                Save full transcript, screenshots, and diffs to .theme-forge/debug/
--no-debug             Disable debug for this run (overrides global setting)
```

### `--debug` Mode

Debug mode can be activated three ways (highest priority first):

1. **`--no-debug` flag** — disables debug for this run, overrides everything
2. **`--debug` flag** — enables debug for this run
3. **Global setting** in `.theme-forge/config.json` → `"debug": true` — applies to all runs

**To toggle the global setting:**
```
/theme-forge --debug on     — sets "debug": true in config.json
/theme-forge --debug off    — sets "debug": false in config.json
```

When handling `/theme-forge --debug on` or `/theme-forge --debug off`:
1. Read `.theme-forge/config.json`
2. Set or update the `"debug"` key (`true` or `false`)
3. Write back the file
4. Confirm: "Debug mode is now **on** globally. All runs will save transcripts and artifacts to `.theme-forge/debug/`. Use `--no-debug` on any command to skip it for one run."

When debug is active (by any method), **thread it through to every sub-skill invocation.** Each pull-section call creates its own debug directory at `.theme-forge/debug/{timestamp}-{section-key}/` with a transcript, screenshots, computed style diffs, and a summary.

After all sections complete, the debug directory contains a full audit trail. A human or another agent can review `.theme-forge/debug/` to diagnose issues without having watched the session live.

### `--full` Workflow

When `--full` is passed, run the **complete migration pipeline from zero to finished site**. This is a one-shot command — it handles its own prerequisites. The user should be able to install theme-forge, open a target theme, and run `/theme-forge --full` with no prior setup.

**Do not skip steps. Do not improvise. Each step checks whether it's already been done and skips if so.**

#### Phase 1: Project Setup (auto-onboard)

1. **Check for config**: Read `.theme-forge/config.json`.
   - **If it exists**: Project is already onboarded. Load config and continue.
   - **If it doesn't exist**: Run the `onboard` sub-skill workflow automatically. This collects the dev store domain, resolves the live URL, detects capabilities, writes config, and sets up `.gitignore`. The onboard skill asks interactive questions (dev store domain, extension prefix) — let it run its full interactive flow.

2. **Commit onboard artifacts** (if onboard just ran):
   ```bash
   git add .theme-forge/config.json .theme-forge/mapping-rules.json \
           .theme-forge/conventions.json .theme-forge/learnings.json .gitignore
   git commit -m "theme-forge: onboard project"
   git push
   ```

#### Phase 2: Base Pull + Global Settings

3. **Targeted base pull**: Pull templates, config, sections, snippets, blocks, layout, and code assets from the live theme. See "Targeted Base Pull" below for the full command. Always run this — it's fast (~10-15 sec) and ensures fresh data.

4. **Check for global maps**: Look for `.theme-forge/settings-map.json` and `.theme-forge/class-map.json`.
   - **If both exist**: Global maps are ready. Continue.
   - **If either is missing**: Run `scan --apply-globals` automatically. This inventories the site, generates the settings cross-reference map (`settings-map.json`), CSS class map (`class-map.json`), and applies global settings (logo, favicon, fonts, colors, body text size) to the target theme's `settings_data.json`. Commit the results:
     ```bash
     git add .theme-forge/settings-map.json .theme-forge/class-map.json \
             .theme-forge/site-inventory.json .theme-forge/plan.json \
             .theme-forge/mappings/ config/settings_data.json
     git commit -m "scan: apply global settings"
     git push
     ```

#### Phase 3: Dev Server

5. **Start dev server** (if not already running): Check if a Shopify dev server is serving this theme on any port 9292-9295.
   ```bash
   for port in 9292 9293 9294 9295; do
     if curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://127.0.0.1:$port" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "200\|301\|302"; then
       echo "DEV_PORT=$port"
       break
     fi
   done
   ```
   - **If found**: Use that port for dev comparisons.
   - **If not found**: Start one in the background:
     ```bash
     # Find the first available port
     for port in 9292 9293 9294 9295; do
       if ! lsof -i :$port -sTCP:LISTEN 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
         DEV_PORT=$port; break
       fi
     done
     shopify theme dev --store <dev_store> --theme <target_theme_id> --port $DEV_PORT --path . &
     ```
     Wait for the dev server to print its preview URL before proceeding. If `target_theme_id` is not in config, use `shopify theme list --store <dev_store>` to find the development/unpublished theme.

#### Phase 4: Globals (Header + Footer)

6. **Pull header**: Check `.theme-forge/reports/sections/header.json`.
   - If it exists with `status: "completed"`: Skip.
   - Otherwise: Run `pull-header`. Commit changes:
     ```bash
     git add sections/ snippets/ assets/ config/ templates/ \
             .theme-forge/reports/sections/header.json \
             .theme-forge/learnings.json .theme-forge/mapping-rules.json
     git commit -m "pull: header — completed"
     git push
     ```

7. **Pull footer**: Check `.theme-forge/reports/sections/footer.json`.
   - If it exists with `status: "completed"`: Skip.
   - Otherwise: Run `pull-footer`. Commit changes:
     ```bash
     git add sections/ snippets/ assets/ config/ templates/ \
             .theme-forge/reports/sections/footer.json \
             .theme-forge/learnings.json .theme-forge/mapping-rules.json
     git commit -m "pull: footer — completed"
     git push
     ```

#### Phase 5: Page Pulls

8. **Enumerate page templates**: List all `.json` template files in the target theme's `templates/` directory. Order them:
   1. `index` (homepage — highest traffic, best first test)
   2. `product` (product pages)
   3. `collection` (collection pages)
   4. `page` (generic pages)
   5. All remaining templates alphabetically (`article`, `blog`, `cart`, `search`, `404`, etc.)

   Skip: `customers/*` templates (account pages, rarely customized), `gift_card`, `password`, and any template alternates (e.g., `page.about.json`) — these are handled after the base templates.

9. **Pull each page**: For each template in order, run `pull-page <template>`. The pull-page sub-skill handles:
   - Scoped scan + map (if mappings don't exist for this page)
   - Section-by-section pull with compare→fix→verify loops
   - Per-section commits and pushes
   - Full-page comparison at the end
   - Page report written to `.theme-forge/reports/pages/`

   **Between pages, `git pull`** to pick up any changes from parallel sessions.

10. **Pull template alternates**: After all base templates are done, enumerate alternates (e.g., `page.about.json`, `page.bridal.json`, `product.featured.json`). Pull each one. These share most sections with their base template, so they're fast — mostly just content/settings differences.

#### Phase 6: Review + Report

11. **Run `review`** on each completed page to catch cross-section issues (inter-section spacing, color continuity, header/footer interaction).

12. **Final summary**: Print a migration status report:
    ```
    MIGRATION COMPLETE
    ==================
    Pages pulled:     8/8
    Sections pulled:  42/42
    Sections skipped: 0
    Sections failed:  0
    Cutover items:    3

    Run /theme-forge cutover for the full go-live checklist.
    ```

**Every section must go through `pull-section`** with its full compare→fix→verify loop. Do not skip the visual comparison. Do not mark sections complete without verification. Do not write section reports without actually running the pull-section workflow on that section.

**Resume after interruption:** Re-running `--full` checks existing artifacts at every step. Onboard is skipped if config exists. Scan is skipped if maps exist. Header/footer are skipped if their reports exist. Each page's sections are skipped if their reports exist. This means `--full` is idempotent — you can safely re-run it after a crash, context limit, or network interruption and it picks up where it left off.

### `--globals-only` Workflow

When `--globals-only` is passed, run Phases 1-4 of the `--full` workflow (project setup, base pull, global settings, dev server, header, footer), commit all results, then stop:

> "Globals, header, and footer are complete. You can now run `pull-page` for individual pages in parallel sessions:"
> ```
> /theme-forge pull-page index
> /theme-forge pull-page product
> /theme-forge pull-page collection
> ```

This is useful for CI pipelines or explicit first-step workflows. In most cases, `pull-page` handles globals automatically (see Git Coordination below).

### Configuration

All project state lives in `.theme-forge/` in the target theme's root. Most files are **committed to the repo** so parallel sessions share the same foundation.

├── cutover.json             # Items requiring manual action during production go-live
└── debug/                   # Debug artifacts — GITIGNORED
```

**`.gitignore` for theme-forge projects:**
```
.theme-forge/base-cache/
.theme-forge/debug/
.theme-forge/tmp/
.theme-forge/references/
.playwright-mcp/
.gstack/
/*.png
```

Everything else in `.theme-forge/` is committed. This is how parallel sessions share mappings, learnings, and see each other's completed work. The `/*.png` catch-all prevents screenshot artifacts from being committed (the agent sometimes saves them to the repo root instead of `.theme-forge/` subdirectories).

### Git Coordination (Parallel Sessions)

Multiple sessions can work on different pages simultaneously. **Git is the coordination layer.** No locks. No state files. No coordination protocol.

**How it works:**

1. **Committed config = onboarding done.** A session reads `.theme-forge/config.json` from the repo. If it exists, the project is onboarded. No setup commands needed.

2. **Committed reports = section done.** A section is complete when its report exists at `.theme-forge/reports/sections/{name}.json` with `status: "completed"`. Before pulling a section, check if its report is already committed. If so, skip it.

3. **Committed mappings = scan done for that page.** Before pulling a page, check `.theme-forge/mappings/pages/{page}.json`. If it exists, the page has been scanned and mapped. If not, run a scoped scan for just that page.

4. **Committed header/footer reports = globals done.** Before pulling page sections, check if `.theme-forge/reports/sections/header.json` and `footer.json` exist with completed status. If not, ask: "Globals not done yet. Run them now?"

**Session lifecycle:**

```
1. git pull                          # Get latest state from repo
2. Read config.json                  # Onboarded? ✓
3. Targeted base pull                # Fresh templates + settings (~5 sec)
4. Read mapping-rules.json           # Apply global mapping conventions
5. Read learnings.json               # Apply accumulated patterns
6. Check reports/sections/header.json # Globals done? If not, ask.
7. Scoped scan + map for this page   # Only if mappings don't exist
8. Pull sections one by one          # Skip if report exists
9. After each section:
   - Commit code changes + report + any new learnings/mapping rules
   - git push
10. Final page comparison + page report
11. Commit + push
```

**Resume after crash:** If a session crashes, it never committed the in-progress section's report. Re-running `pull-page` sees no report for that section and re-attempts it. No staleness detection needed. No locks to go stale.

**Duplicate work prevention:** Two sessions assigned to the same page will both start pulling. Before each section, they `git pull` and check for a committed report. The second session to finish a section sees the first session already committed a report and skips. At most one section gets duplicated.

### Targeted Base Pull

Sessions do NOT need a full base theme export. The agent needs templates, config, sections, snippets, blocks, and layout from the live theme for mapping, code analysis, and comparison.

**The base-cache directory must be a git repo** (Shopify CLI requires it):

```bash
mkdir -p .theme-forge/base-cache && git -C .theme-forge/base-cache init 2>/dev/null
shopify theme pull --theme <live_theme_id> \
  --only 'templates/*' --only 'config/*' \
  --only 'sections/*' --only 'snippets/*' \
  --only 'blocks/*' --only 'layout/*' \
  --only 'assets/*.css' --only 'assets/*.js' \
  --path .theme-forge/base-cache/
```

**Why all these directories:**
- `templates/*` + `config/*` — section composition and configured values
- `sections/*` — base section Liquid code, schemas, CSS, HTML structure. **Without these, the agent cannot see how the base theme implements forms, JS handlers, conditional logic, or custom blocks.**
- `snippets/*` — shared components the sections reference (form handlers, tracking scripts, utility includes)
- `blocks/*` — block type definitions and schemas
- `layout/*` — theme layout structure, global includes, script/style references
- `assets/*.css` + `assets/*.js` — stylesheets and JavaScript (needed to understand form handlers, AJAX patterns, tracking code). Excludes images and fonts to keep the pull fast.

**Note on `--only` patterns:** Use quoted globs (`'templates/*'`), not directory paths (`templates/`). The Shopify CLI `--only` flag uses glob matching, not directory filtering.

**Legacy themes (liquid-only templates):** If the base theme uses `.liquid` templates instead of `.json` templates, the pull will still work — but section composition lives in `config/settings_data.json` under the `current` key, not in template JSON files. See "Legacy Theme Support" in the scan skill.

This takes ~10-15 seconds and is always fresh. Each session runs it independently. The results are gitignored (session-local).

### Scoped Scan

Instead of scanning the entire site before any work, sessions scan only the page they need:

1. Read `templates/{page}.json` from the target theme
2. Read `templates/{page}.json` from `.theme-forge/base-cache/`
3. Cross-reference sections, apply `mapping-rules.json`
4. Write `mappings/pages/{page}.json` and `mappings/sections/*.json`
5. Commit the mappings

The full `scan` command still exists for when you want a complete inventory, but it's not a prerequisite.

### Mapping Rules (`mapping-rules.json`)

Global registry of base→target section mappings. Ensures all sessions use the same mappings for the same section types.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "base_type": "slideshow",
      "target_type": "hero-banner",
      "notes": "Use hero-banner for all carousel/slideshow sections"
    },
    {
      "base_type": "testimonials",
      "target_type": "custom-testimonial-carousel",
      "notes": "Custom section, no direct equivalent in target theme"
    }
  ],
  "updated_at": "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Workflow:**
- During scoped scan, the agent checks mapping-rules.json first. Known mappings are applied instantly.
- When a new section type is encountered with no rule, the agent creates a mapping and adds a rule.
- New rules are committed so other sessions benefit.

### Conventions (`conventions.json`)

Global standards that all sessions follow:

```json
{
  "css_first": true,
  "extension_prefix": "custom-",
  "never_modify_core_files": true,
  "max_retry_attempts": 3,
  "accepted_variance_threshold_px": 1,
  "commit_after_each_section": true
}
```

Created during onboard. Committed to repo.

### Resume Protocol

Resume is report-based. No state machine.

When `pull-page` starts:

1. `git pull` to get latest committed state
2. Read `.theme-forge/reports/sections/*.json` for this page's sections
3. Skip sections with a report where `status` is `completed` or `completed_code_only`
4. Skip sections with `status: "skipped"`
5. Skip sections with `status: "failed"` (use `--retry-failed` to delete failed reports first)
6. Pull all remaining sections (no report = not started)

Kill a run and restart it. It picks up where it left off.

### Platform Detection

theme-forge works across Claude Code, Cowork, and OpenClaw. It detects available capabilities on first run:

| Capability | Claude Code | Cowork | OpenClaw |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| File read/write | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bash/shell | ✓ | ✓ (sandboxed) | ✓ |
| Browse tool | Maybe | Maybe | Maybe |
| Computer use | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Subagents | ✓ | ✓ | ? |

When no browse tool is available, visual comparison falls back to code-only analysis. When Shopify CLI is unavailable, dev preview is skipped with instructions for manual verification.

### Architecture Principles

1. **Theme-agnostic**: Works for any base→target Shopify theme migration, not just legacy→Horizon. Extension layer prefix is configurable.
2. **Visual-first, code-capable**: Browse tools (gstack browse, Playwright MCP) enable pixel-level comparison; without them, falls back to schema/CSS/settings analysis.
3. **Non-destructive**: `map-*` and `scan` never modify files. `pull-*` modifies only the target theme, never the base theme.
4. **Git-native coordination**: The repo is the single source of truth. Committed reports = done. Committed mappings = scanned. No locks, no state machine. Parallel sessions coordinate through git commits.
5. **Zero-ceremony sessions**: A new session reads config.json, pulls fresh base data (~5 sec), and starts working. No setup commands, no prerequisites beyond onboard.
6. **Composable**: Each command works independently. `scan` composes them into a pipeline, but you can `map-section` one section without a full migration.

### Extension Layer Convention

All customizations in the target theme go in namespaced files. The default prefix is `custom-` (configurable in `config.json`):

- `sections/{prefix}*.liquid`
- `snippets/{prefix}*.liquid`
- `assets/{prefix}*.css`, `assets/{prefix}*.js`
- `blocks/{prefix}*.liquid`

NEVER modify the target theme's core files. This preserves upstream upgradability.

### Safety Rules

- **NEVER run `shopify theme push` or `shopify theme publish` without explicit user approval.** All theme work happens locally. The `shopify theme dev` server hot-reloads local files, so pushing is unnecessary during development. When the user is ready to push, they will tell you. This is a bright red line — no exceptions, no "just pushing config", no "only pushing one file".
- **NEVER access the production store's Shopify admin.** The live site is read-only (public storefront only).
- **NEVER modify the base theme files.** The base theme export is a read-only reference.
- **NEVER change content copy** (headings, body text, button labels) without explicit instruction. The live site is the source of truth for content.
